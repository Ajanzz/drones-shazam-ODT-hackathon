Using machine learning and signal processing, the app provides a **low-cost, portable and scalable solution** for drone detection, making airspace security accessible to governments, businesses and everyday individuals

## 🚀 Features
- **Drone Detection via Sound**: Identifies drones using their sound signatures
- **Machine Learning Models**: Classifies different drone types in real time
- **Low-Cost Deployment**: Requires only microphones, no radar towers or specialized hardware
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices
- **Scalable**: Suitable for homes, stadiums, airports, and military bases
- **Visualization**: Generates heat map pinpointing nearby drones in the area
 
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch (ML), FastAPI (backend), React + Vite (frontend)
- **Tools**: Signal processing libraries (Librosa)
- **Data**: Acoustic datasets of drone sounds and background noise
